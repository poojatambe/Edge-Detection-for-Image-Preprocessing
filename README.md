# Edge-Detection-for-Image-Preprocessing
Exploring and understanding edge detection methods in computer vision.

**Edge detection is primary image processing task. We will explore various edge detection methods and compare their outputs.**

## Edge Detection Methods:
* Sobel
* Prewitt
* Robert
* Laplacian of guassian
* Canny
* Holistically-Nested 

  
To implement edge detection, run command:
```
streamlit run main.py
```
